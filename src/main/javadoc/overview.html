  <h1>Extensions to JUnit providing additional assertions</h1>
    This project is inspired by the Scala Test libraries and how one can mix in Traits to get new behavior in the test code. <br>
	Java 8 introduced default methods in Interfaces providing much similar functionality as the Trait in Scala. <br>
	With that in the toolbox this library introduces interfaces with additional assert operations. It allows you as a programmer to write test classes and mix-in additional interfaces to get richer assert operations. <br>

	<h2>How To Use</h2>
	<pre><code>
import static javascalautils.OptionCompanion.Option;
import static javascalautils.TryCompanion.Try;
import junitextensions.OptionAssert;
import junitextensions.TryAssert;
import org.junit.Test;

/**
 * Example test class illustrating how to use the assert interfaces from this library. 
 * The interfaces allows mixing in new behavior.
 */
public class ExampleTestClass implements OptionAssert, TryAssert {

	&#64;Test
	public void assertingSome() {
		String expected = "Some is never None";
		//this method is inherited from OptionAssert
		assertSomeEquals(expected, Option(expected));
	}
	
	&#64;Test
	public void getNoneExistingItemFromMap() {
		//this method is inherited from OptionAssert
		assertIsNone(Option(null));
	}
	
	&#64;Test
	public void assertingSuccess(){
		//this method is inherited from TryAssert
		assertSuccessEquals(66, Try(() -> 33*2));
	}

	&#64;Test
	public void assertingFailure(){		
		//this method is inherited from TryAssert
		assertIsFailure(Try(() -> 69/0)); //division by zero, will fail
	}
}
